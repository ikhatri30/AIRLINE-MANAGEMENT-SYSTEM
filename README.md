# AIRLINE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The Airline Management System is a comprehensive application designed to streamline and automate various aspects of airline operations.<br />
It provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for managing flights, bookings, cancellations, and more. <br />
By integrating with a MySQL database, this system ensures efficient data handling.<br />

# Installation and Setup
a) Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.x
2. MySQL Server
3. Required Python libraries: mysql-connector-python, tkinter, Pillow

b) Setup Instructions
1. Download the repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Ensure MySQL Server is running and create a database named airline_mgmt with appropriate tables.
4. Update the MySQL connection parameters (host, user, password, database) in the script.
5. Run the script using python <script_name>.py.

# Features
a) Flight Management:<br />
1. Add Flight: Enter and save new flight details including flight number, origin, destination, departure time, arrival time, and available seats.
2. View Flights: Retrieve and display all flight information stored in the database.<br />

b) Ticket Management:<br />
1. Book Ticket: Book tickets by providing flight ID, passenger name, and contact details. The system checks seat availability and updates the database accordingly.
2. Cancel Ticket: Cancel existing bookings by providing the booking ID. The system updates seat availability upon cancellation.<br />
3. Verify Ticket: Verify ticket details using the booking ID to retrieve information such as flight number and passenger contact details.<br />

c) Priority Services:<br />
1. Book Priority Slots: Schedule priority slots for check-in and boarding, ensuring passengers receive expedited services.<br />

d) Crowd Management:<br />
1. View Crowd Levels: Access and display crowd level information for different areas of the airport to help manage and reduce overcrowding.<br />

e) Luggage Services:<br />
1. Schedule Luggage Drop-off: Schedule luggage drop-off times for passengers, facilitating a smoother travel experience.<br />

# Possible Future Additions with Other Technologies
a) Artificial Intelligence (AI): <br />
1. Predictive Analytics: Integrate AI algorithms to predict flight delays, optimize seat allocation, and personalize passenger services based on historical data.
2. Chatbots: Enhance customer support with AI-powered chatbots that can handle booking queries, provide flight information, and assist with cancellations.<br />

b)Internet of Things (IoT):<br />
1. Smart Luggage Tracking: Implement IoT devices for real-time luggage tracking and updates, improving luggage handling and reducing loss incidents.
2. Crowd Sensing: Use IoT sensors to monitor and manage crowd levels more effectively, ensuring a safer and more comfortable environment for passengers.<br />

c) Blockchain:<br />
1. Secure Transactions: Leverage blockchain technology to enhance the security and transparency of ticket transactions and passenger data management.
2. Smart Contracts: Utilize smart contracts for automating and securing booking agreements, cancellations, and priority slot reservations.<br />

d) Mobile Integration:<br />
1. Mobile App Integration: Develop mobile applications that integrate with the system, allowing passengers to book and manage tickets, check flight status, and receive real-time updates on their smartphones.<br />

e) Enhanced Security:<br />
1. Implement user authentication mechanisms such as username/password, two-factor authentication, and biometric logins.
2. Encrypt sensitive financial data to protect it from unauthorized access.<br />
